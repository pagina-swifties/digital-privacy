        Data breaches in today's data-driven world can affect hundreds of
        millions, if not billions, of people at once. As the supply of data
        moving has increased due to digital transformation, so have data
        breaches as attackers exploit the data-dependencies of everyday life.
        Below are some examples of data breaches that occurred with big

              in the sense that there was not a breach in the company's servers,
              but an authentication error, meaning no authentication was
              required to view documents. There was a common web design error
              called Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), which basically
              means that anyone who searches the direct link will have access to
              it. Once a single link is found, cyber criminals can use Advanced
              Persistent Bots (APBs) to collect and index the remaining
              documents. This error went undiscovered for years. The New York
              DFS alleges that First American failed to follow its own policies,
              neglecting to conduct a security review or a risk assessment of
              the flawed computer program.

              users. The security vulnerability that enabled the breach was a
              server configuration change that allowed unauthorized access by
              third parties. This has now been resolved.

        The occurance of a data breach have severe consequences that affects the

            <dt>Unauthorized Data access</dt>
            <dd>
              The heaviest consequence of data breach is the access of personal
              and private information of the system's users. This usually
              happens through either network-based or social attack.

            <dd>
              The occurance of a data breach in a company decreases the
              confidence level of customers. This results to decrease in sales
              and company reputation that is difficult to recover from.

              After the event of a data breach, the company can be held
              responsible for the security breach which may result to legal
              actions against them. The cost of such action can be substantial,

        Protection of an individual's information used or created using the
        internet defines digital privacy. Privacy incorporates two crucial
        elements-- our state of being alone and not being watched or interrupted
        by others. To have digital privacy and confidentiality of all
        information and data should be protected and be the core values of all
        tech companies. Digital privacy also covers the protection and
        expectation of having your behavior and location not tracked and that
        using our digital devices can leave digital footprints.

        <h3 class="highlight">Why Should We Care About Privacy Protection?</h3>
        <br />
        Most of us use different types of social media and are vulnerable to
        exposing our personal information as we post on social media. Sometimes,
        we fail to realize that we are revealing more of our personal
        information to others than what we are okay with. We must be aware that
        even our private conversations can be leaked to the public if we are not
        careful, and there's a possibility that our hackers will change our
        credentials to the point that we cannot access our accounts anymore.
        <br /><br />
        <strong><i>Cybercriminals</i></strong> can access and violate users'
        data as they can make a profit by getting their passwords to different
        accounts or using it as blackmail to get money from victims.
        Cybercriminals can also sell stolen data on the black market across most
        countries. <br /><br />
        <h2>Benefits of Privacy Protection</h2>
        <div class="card-container">

              <h2>It keeps your information safe.</h2>
              <p>
                Privacy protection protects your browsing history, account
                credentials, private messages, transactions, etc. If there's no
                privacy protection, all your personal information is valuable to
                cybercriminals.

                A hacker can utilize the network to access your personal
                information. Privacy protection tools like VPN will hide your IP
                address and prevent the ISP from monitoring your activity. The
                VPN will also hide your private information and make a Wi-Fi
                connection secure to your device.

        Most people who surf the internet are not aware of how susceptible they
        are to the dangers of the internet. Most of them are unaware that they
        are voluntarily sharing their information to the public due to the fact
        that they do not know what data privacy is. Keeping data means keeping
        it isolated within the person-service relationship. Alas a lot of people
        leave their personal information public and here is where data privacy
        issues come in. Here are some of the major and most common data privacy
        issues:

            On the internet there are things called “cookies”. Cookies can track
            multiple visits to the same site over time. Most of the time this
            tracking is for advertising purposes only. The information web
            owners gain from this allows them to suggest other items that might
            interest visitors. But sometimes this information is used by
            cybercriminals to carry out unauthorized activities risking your
            online existence.

            As mentioned in above cookies mostly are used in advertisements but
            there are some internet sites that need your personal information
            and these sites often store cookies and save your personal
            information and later use it for various purposes and most of the
            time the information saved is not encrypted and can be accessed by
            anyone. The mishandling of this information will surely be taken
            advantage of by cybercriminals which may lead to serious
            consequences.

            Phone and computer operating systems, Web browsers, popular apps,
            and even smart-home devices receive frequent updates with new
            features and security improvements. These security updates are
            typically far better at thwarting hackers than antivirus software.
            Most web browsers and phone OS that you use have automatic updates.
            If you want to double-check if your phone's auto-update is
            activated, you can check it under System Update in your Settings.

          <h2>2FA</h2>
          <p>
            Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an effective and increasingly
            important weapon in the IT manager's armory. 2FA delivers an extra
            layer of protection for user accounts that, while not impregnable,
            significantly decreases the risk of unauthorized access and system
            breaches. Examples of 2FA which are commonly used are SMS &amp;
            email authentication, one-time passwords, fingerprint/voice
            recognition.

          <h2>OTP</h2>
          <p>
            A one-time password (OTP) is a system-generated string of characters
            that authenticates the user for a one-time use login or transaction
            session. It is an additional layer of protection to the user's
            account. An OTP is Helping our digital privacy. The one-time
            password avoids sharing credentials and reusing the same password on
            multiple accounts. A one-time password is also customized to be
            invalid in minutes, preventing attackers from getting it or even
            reusing it.

          <h2>Strong Password</h2>
          <p>
            Passwords provide the first line of defense against unauthorized
            access to your computer and personal information. The stronger your
            password, the more protected your computer will be from hackers and
            malicious software. You should maintain strong passwords for all
            accounts on your computer.

        We, the Swifties, started this site for our project about web development. 
        We chose to tackle data privacy as our topic because we aim to spread awareness about 
        the importance of data privacy. We strive to let others know that our personal information 
        online is vulnerable to being exposed online if we are not careful. We are not doing this 
        mainly just for compliance's sake. We do this because we want that the content of our website 
        will be helpful to others.
