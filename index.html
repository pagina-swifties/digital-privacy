                <h2>Update softwares and devices</h2>
                <p>
                    Phone and computer operating systems, Web browsers, popular apps, and even smart-home devices receive frequent updates with new features and security improvements. 
                    These security updates are typically far better at thwarting hackers than antivirus software. Most web browsers and phone OS that you use have automatic updates. 
                    If you want to double-check if your phone's auto-update is activated, you can check it under System Update in your Settings.

                <p>
                    Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an effective and increasingly important weapon in the IT manager's armory. 
                    2FA delivers an extra layer of protection for user accounts that, while not impregnable, significantly decreases the risk of unauthorized access and system breaches. 
                    Examples of 2FA which are commonly used are SMS & email authentication, one-time passwords, fingerprint/voice recognition.

                <h2>OTP</h2>
                <p>
                    A one-time password (OTP) is a system-generated string of characters that authenticates the user for a one-time use login or transaction session. 
                    It is an additional layer of protection to the user's account. An OTP is Helping our digital privacy. 
                    The one-time password avoids sharing credentials and reusing the same password on multiple accounts. 
                    A one-time password is also customized to be invalid in minutes, preventing attackers from getting it or even reusing it.

            <li>
                <h2>Strong Password</h2>
                <p>
                    Passwords provide the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your computer and personal information. 
                    The stronger your password, the more protected your computer will be from hackers and malicious software. 
                    You should maintain strong passwords for all accounts on your computer.

        <div class="section-heading"> <span style="color: #ffa31a"> Data Breach</span></div>
        <div class="section-content"> Data Breach is the result of an attack towards a system, allowing unauthorized access to essential data. <br> 
          <br>Data Breach have severe consequences that affects the system and its owners that may result in the following:<br><br>
              <ol>
                <li><em>Unauthorized Data access</em></li><br>
                  The heaviest consequence of data breach is the access of personal and private information of the system's users. This usually happens through either network-based or social attack.<br>
                <br>
                <li><em>Decrease in Sales and Company Reputation</em></li><br>
                  The occurance of a data breach in a company decreases the confidence level of customers. This results to decrease in sales and company reputation that is difficult to recover from.<br>
                  <br><li><em>Legal Penalties Against the Organization</em></li><br>
                  After the event of a data breach, the company can be held responsible for the security breach which may result to legal actions against them. The cost of such action can be substantial, especially for small-medium companies.<br>
                  <br><li><em>Online Vandalism</em><br>
                  Some data breaches are done for entertainment purposes. For this reason, hackers temper sites with false information or deface a website.
