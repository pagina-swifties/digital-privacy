        <div class="section-content">Protection of an individual's information used or created using the internet defines digital privacy. Privacy incorporates two crucial elements-- our state of being alone and not being watched or interrupted by others.
            <br>To have digital privacy and confidentiality of all information and data should be protected and be the core values of all tech companies.
            <br>Digital privacy also covers the protection and expectation of having your behavior and location not tracked and that using our digital devices can leave digital footprints.
