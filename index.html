        <div class="section-content"> Data breaches in today's data-driven world can affect hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people at once. 
            As the supply of data moving has increased due to digital transformation, so have data breaches as attackers exploit the data-dependencies of 
            everyday life. Below are some examples of data breaches that occurred with big companies.

                    and Vietnam. Facebook announced in 2018 that it would make changes to "better protect people's information," yet this incident

            Most of us use different types of social media and are vulnerable to exposing our personal information as we post on 
            social media. Sometimes, we fail to realize that we are revealing more of our personal information to others than what we are okay with. 
            We must be aware that even our private conversations can be leaked to 
            the public if we are not careful, and there's a possibility that our hackers will change our credentials to the point that we cannot access our 
            accounts anymore.
            <br><br>
            <strong><i>Cybercriminals</i></strong> can access and violate users' data as they can make a profit by getting their passwords to different accounts or using it as blackmail to get money from victims. Cybercriminals can also sell stolen data on the black market across most countries.

        <div class="section-content">
            Most people who surf the internet are not aware of how susceptible they are to the dangers of the internet.
            Most of them are unaware that they are voluntarily sharing their information to the public due to the fact
            that they
            do not know what data privacy is. Keeping data means keeping it isolated within the person-service
            relationship.
            Alas a lot of people leave their personal information public and here is where data privacy issues come in.
            Here are some of the major and most common data privacy issues:

                <p>On the internet there are things called “cookies”. Cookies can track multiple visits to the same site
                    over time.
                    Most of the time this tracking is for advertising purposes only. The information web owners gain from
                    this allows
                    them to suggest other items that might interest visitors. But sometimes this information is used by
                    cybercriminals
                    to carry out unauthorized activities risking your online existence.

                    later use it for
                    various purposes and most of the time the information saved is not encrypted and can be accessed by
                    anyone.
                    The mishandling of this information will surely be taken advantage of by cybercriminals which may
                    lead to serious

                    Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an effective and increasingly important weapon in the IT manager's armory. 
                    2FA delivers an extra layer of protection for user accounts that, while not impregnable, significantly decreases the risk of unauthorized access and system breaches. 
                    Examples of 2FA which are commonly used are SMS & email authentication, one-time passwords, fingerprint/voice recognition.

                    A one-time password (OTP) is a system-generated string of characters that authenticates the user for a one-time use login or transaction session. 
                    It is an additional layer of protection to the user's account. An OTP is Helping our digital privacy. 
                    The one-time password avoids sharing credentials and reusing the same password on multiple accounts. 
                    A one-time password is also customized to be invalid in minutes, preventing attackers from getting it or even reusing it.
