              <ol>
                <li><em>Unauthorized Data access</em></li><br>
                  The heaviest consequence of data breach is the access of personal and private information of the system's users. This usually happens through either network-based or social attack.<br>
                <br>
                <li><em>Decrease in Sales and Company Reputation</em></li><br>
                  The occurance of a data breach in a company decreases the confidence level of customers. This results to decrease in sales and company reputation that is difficult to recover from.<br>
                  <br><li><em>Legal Penalties Against the Organization</em></li><br>
                  After the event of a data breach, the company can be held responsible for the security breach which may result to legal actions against them. The cost of such action can be substantial, especially for small-medium companies.<br>
                  <br><li><em>Online Vandalism</em><br>
                  Some data breaches are done for entertainment purposes. For this reason, hackers temper sites with false information or deface a website.
