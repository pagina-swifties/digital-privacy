        <div class="section-content"> Data breaches in today's data-driven world can affect hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people at once. 
            As the supply of data moving has increased due to digital transformation, so have data breaches as attackers exploit the data-dependencies of 
            everyday life. Below are some examples of data breaches that occurred with big companies.

            <section class = "consequences-list">
                <dl>

                    meaning anyone who searched the internet could find them. The databases cover multiple locations, including the U.S., the U.K., 
                    and Vietnam. Facebook announced in 2018 that it would make changes to "better protect people's information," yet this incident 
                    occurred in 2019, showing there were still flaws in their security systems.</dd>

                        but an authentication error, meaning no authentication was required to view documents. There was a common web design error called Insecure 
                        Direct Object Reference (IDOR), which basically means that anyone who searches the direct link will have access to it. Once a single link 
                        is found, cyber criminals can use Advanced Persistent Bots (APBs) to collect and index the remaining documents. This error went undiscovered
                         for years. The New York DFS alleges that First American failed to follow its own policies, neglecting to conduct a security review or a risk 
                         assessment of the flawed computer program. </dd>

                        that enabled the breach was a server configuration change that allowed unauthorized access by third parties. This has now been resolved.  </dd>

            <h3>Why Should We Care About Privacy Protection?</em></h3><br>
            Most of us use different types of social media and are vulnerable to exposing our personal information as we post on 
            social media. Sometimes, we fail to realize that we are revealing more of our personal information to others than what we are okay with. 
            We must be aware that even our private conversations can be leaked to 
            the public if we are not careful, and there's a possibility that our hackers will change our credentials to the point that we cannot access our 
            accounts anymore.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong><i>Cybercriminals</i></strong> can access and violate users' data as they can make a profit by getting their passwords to different accounts or using it as blackmail to get money from victims. Cybercriminals can also sell stolen data on the black market across most countries.

                    Phone and computer operating systems, Web browsers, popular apps, and even smart-home devices receive frequent updates with new features and security improvements. 
                    These security updates are typically far better at thwarting hackers than antivirus software. Most web browsers and phone OS that you use have automatic updates. 
                    If you want to double-check if your phone's auto-update is activated, you can check it under System Update in your Settings.

                    Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an effective and increasingly important weapon in the IT manager's armory. 
                    2FA delivers an extra layer of protection for user accounts that, while not impregnable, significantly decreases the risk of unauthorized access and system breaches. 
                    Examples of 2FA which are commonly used are SMS & email authentication, one-time passwords, fingerprint/voice recognition.

                <p>
                    A one-time password (OTP) is a system-generated string of characters that authenticates the user for a one-time use login or transaction session. 
                    It is an additional layer of protection to the user's account. An OTP is Helping our digital privacy. 
                    The one-time password avoids sharing credentials and reusing the same password on multiple accounts. 
                    A one-time password is also customized to be invalid in minutes, preventing attackers from getting it or even reusing it.

                    Passwords provide the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your computer and personal information. 
                    The stronger your password, the more protected your computer will be from hackers and malicious software. 
                    You should maintain strong passwords for all accounts on your computer.
